    "# Use case\n",
    "1. Reviewing tool calls, so humans can review, edit or approve tool calls requested by LLMs\n",
    "2. validating llm output\n",
    "3. providing context: Enable the llm to explictly request human input for clarification, for clarifaction or for multi turn conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Design patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Approve or reject: Pause the graph before a critical step such as api call, to review and approve an action. This pattern involves routing the graph based on human input.\n",
    "2. Review or Edit:  The human can review and update the graph feeding it extra information, a human can also review tool calls and edit the output from the llm before proceding.\n",
