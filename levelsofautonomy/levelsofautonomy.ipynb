    "\n",
    "1. Code -> This has zero autonomy and is 100% deterministic\n",
    "2. LLM call-> A single LLM call means your app basically does one thing you give it an input it process it and it returns you an output, This is a huge leap from hard coded rules and is the second step of autonomy\n",
    "    \n",
    "    disadvantage:\n",
    "    Trying to do everything in one go leads to confusion/ mixed responses.\n",
    "3. Chains: This is like having a group of specialist\n",
    "     disadvantage:\n",
    "     They are rigid and always tend to follow the steps defined by the human.\n",
    "4. Router: Instead of having a defined path like in the chains. Router decide on which route to take eg a personal assistant bot, which first decides if you need help in scheduling, research or calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    disadvantage:\n",
    "    It can not remember previous conversations or learn from mistakes\n",
    "5. State Machine(agent):\n",
    "    This is combining the previous level router but with loops\n",
    "    Agent~ control flow controlled by an LLM\n",
    "    This feature involves:\n",
    "      1. Ability to have human in the loop, ask for approval before moving on\n",
    "      2. Multi agent system\n",
    "      3. Advanced memory management\n",
    "      4. Going back in history and exploring better alternatives\n",
    "      5. Adaptive learning\n",

    "A chain/router is one directional hence not an `agent`. whereas in a state machine we can go back in the chain and flow is controlled by LLM\n"
